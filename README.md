# azure-resume
Kimon Pope's resume built using Microsoft Azure.
To create the website, I followed [ACG Project #403 - Build Your Resume on Azure with Azure Blob, Storage, Functions, Cosmos DB, and Github Actions](https://acloud.guru/series/acg-projects/view/403) 
## First steps

- Frontend folder contains the website.
